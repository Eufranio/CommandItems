# CommandItems
CommandItems is a simple Sponge plugin that aims to bring the command items features from the old CraftBook plugin to Sponge. With this plugin, you can have custom items that can be used and execute commands, consume the item, execute only on right or left click, execute commands as player/console, etc!

## Setup
The plugin is drag and drop: once it loaded, edit the config as you like. If you want to add more items to the config, use `/citems create` in-game so it creates a new item with the specified name and inserts in the current config.

## Commands and Permissions
* /citems create [name] | `commanditems.create` | Creates a item on your config
* /citems give [name] [amount] [player] | `commanditems.give` | Gives [amount] keys named `name` for you or `player`, if specified. The item can be created via `/citems create [name]` (see above), or you can rename the name in the config to another name and use it here.
* /citems | `commanditems.main` | Main plugin command, lists the other commands and their usage
